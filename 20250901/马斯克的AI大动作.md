Elon Musk wanted Mark Zuckerberg to join his $97.4 billion deal to buy OpenAI

Elon Musk had attempted to rope in Mark Zuckerberg for the $97.4 billion bid to take over Sam Altman's OpenAI, but the Meta founder did not come on board, a court filing showed on Thursday.

The move can be called surprising, given that it came just a year and a half year after the two tech billionaires locked horns in public and even geared up to go against each other in a cage fight.

The court filing, made by the ChatGPT maker before the Northern District of California federal court, came as part of the ongoing legal battle between Musk and OpenAI. OpenAI said Musk identified Mark Zuckerberg as one of the people with whom he has communicated about potentially financing a deal to purchase the ChatGPT maker.
OpenAI alleged that the Tesla CEO had disclosed about his communications with Zuckerberg during sworn interrogations.

The Sam Altman-led company, which is best known for its AI chatbot ChatGPT, has sought directions from a federal judge to order Meta Platforms to produce documents and any form of communication related on OpenAI. It has also sought for orders for Meata to disclose documents "concerning any actual or protential restructuring or recapotalization of OpenAI."
