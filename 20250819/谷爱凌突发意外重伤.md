Eileen Gu Injured in a "Very Terrible Accident" While Training at Cardrona Resort, New Zealand

Chinese freestyle skiing star Eileen Gu has been injured during training in New Zealand on Friday, August 15, describing the incident as a "very terrible accident" caused by human error. The 21-year-old Olympic gold medialist was immediately flown to Christchurch for media imaging on Saturday to access the extent of her injuries, the athlete shared on Chinese social media platform Weibo.

Gu had recently resumed on-snow training after months of recovering from previuos injuries, which had forced her to miss major events, including the Asia Winter Games and serveral World Cup competitions, earlier this year. Her training at Cardrona Alpine Resort went smoothly until the accident occurred on Friday.

In a detailed post on Weibo, Gu expressed gratitude for the support from friends and fans but emphasized the critical need for concentration during training. She warned that interruptions, such as fans filming or taking photos while she is practiciing, are dangerous and could lead to accidents. Gu explained that even while on the lift, she must focus on visualizing her runs and avoids typical breaks like lunch or bathroom stops to maximize training time.

This latest injury adds to a series of setbacks for Gu, who has endured mutiple injuries through the 2024-25 season, including contusions sustained at the Aspen X Games and a fractured shoulder that sidelined her from the Asian Winter Games. Despite  these chanllenges, Gu remains focused on recovery and preparation for the 2026 Milan Winter Olympics.
